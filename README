*** CURRENTLY FOR 1.12A ONLY ***

Includes all ES 3.00 R6D changes not in my other mods.

Ported from ES 3.00 R6D direct dll hacks.

Features:
	* Quest skill rewards multiplied by 2
	* Akara gives a rare grand charm for rescuing Cain
	* Ormus gives a jewel instead of ring
	* Adds the Marrowwalk "bug" back
	* Other stuff I've yet to decipher!

Install (ADVANCED):
	* Only tested with ES 3.00 R6D and R6E!
	* Backup your es300r dir
	* Save es300r/data/global/excel/itemratios.txt while the game is running.
	* Copy it back when you exit.  ES 3.00 R crashes on drops without it.
	* Erase all .dlls in your es300r dir
	* Copy the PlugY 9.00 (or higher) dll to es300r
	* Copy es300.dll to your es300r dir
	* Install my other mods (check author or use site; mod names ambiguous)
		loader
		mercmod
		gemfix
		savesize
		goldlim
	* Add all of them (including es300.dll) to loader.ini (see loader docs)
	* Add loader.dll to PlugY.ini's DllToLoad
	* Launch Game.exe from your es300r dir with -direct -txt to play
	* Hope everything went right.
